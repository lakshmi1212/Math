# Math Operations

This repository provides basic math operations (addition and subtraction) implemented in Python, along with test cases and CI/CD integration metadata.

## File Structure

- `src/math_operations.py`: Contains the implementation of addition and subtraction functions.
- `tests/test_add.py`: Contains test cases for the `add` function.
- `tests/test_subtract.py`: Contains test cases for the `subtract` function.
- `math.json`: Metadata file for CI/CD integration.
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the tests using `pytest`.

## Workflow

1. Implement math operations in `math_operations.py`.
2. Write test cases in `tests` folder.
3. Generate `math.json` for CI/CD integration.
4. Commit all files to GitHub.
