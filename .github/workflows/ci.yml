# =============================================================
# CI Pipeline for lakshmi1212/Math
#
# This workflow runs pytest on every push and pull request to main.
# It ensures all tests in the 'tests' directory are executed on Python 3.10.
#
# Troubleshooting & Documentation:
# - Test logs are available in the Actions tab for each run.
# - If tests fail, the job will fail and a red X will be shown.
# - Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
# - For troubleshooting, review the 'Install dependencies' and 'Run tests' steps output.
#
# Recommendations:
# - For large projects, consider test matrix for multiple Python versions.
# - Use pytest-cov for coverage reporting if needed.
# - Integrate status badges in README for CI visibility.
