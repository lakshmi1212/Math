# Math Operations

## Overview
This repository contains basic math operations implemented in Python, including addition and subtraction. It also includes pytest test files for verifying the correctness of these operations.

## Folder Structure
- `src`: Contains the main logic files (`add.py` and `subtract.py`).
- `tests`: Contains pytest test files (`test_add.py` and `test_subtract.py`).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lakshmi1212/Math.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd Math
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Workflow
- All production logic is stored in the `src` folder.
- All test files are stored in the `tests` folder.
- Tests validate the correctness of the math operations.
