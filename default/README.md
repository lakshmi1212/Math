# Math Operations

This project provides basic mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. It also includes test cases for these operations.

## Usage

- To perform addition: `add(a, b)`
- To perform subtraction: `subtract(a, b)`

## Workflow

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run tests: `pytest tests`

## Project Structure

- `src/math_operations.py`: Contains the logic for addition and subtraction.
- `tests/test_add.py`: Test cases for addition.
- `tests/test_subtract.py`: Test cases for subtraction.
