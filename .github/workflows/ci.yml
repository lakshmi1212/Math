# CI Pipeline for Math Repository
#
# This workflow runs pytest-based tests on every push and pull request to the main branch.
# It ensures all code changes are validated before merging or deployment.
#
# Key Features:
# - Triggers on push and pull request events targeting main
# - Uses Python 3.10
# - Installs dependencies from requirements.txt
# - Runs all tests in the tests/ directory
# - Fails the pipeline if any test fails
# - Provides clear error output and test reports
#
# Troubleshooting Guide:
# - If the workflow fails, check the 'Run Pytest' step logs for detailed error messages.
# - Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
# - For environment issues, verify Python version compatibility and runner logs.
#
# Recommendations:
# - For scalability, consider parallel test execution using pytest-xdist.
# - Integrate code coverage reporting (e.g., with pytest-cov and Codecov) for enhanced quality metrics.
# - Use status badges in README for workflow visibility.
#
# For further assistance, see the README or contact the DevOps team.
